# DMP : Defold Music Player

It's a library for playing music modules (xm, s3m, mod, it …) with Defold.

It's using as backbone the DUMB replayer (http://dumb.sourceforge.net/ and https://github.com/kode54/dumb).

You can use it as a standalone lib, with Löve2D for example.

Löve2D has already its own lib for module replay (it uses libmodplug). But with DMP, you can get rows informations during the replay.



## Creating DMP library

```
Make
```



## Testing

```
./libdmp_test.lua
```
